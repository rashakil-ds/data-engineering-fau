# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analyzing Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the United States

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. What are the key contributors to greenhouse gas emissions across various industries in the United States?
2. How do these emissions compare to other regions in the Americas?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project aims to explore greenhouse gas emissions from different industries within the United States, based on the 'Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors by NAICS 6' dataset. By analyzing emissions data by industry, the project will identify sectors with the highest emissions, allowing for a comparison with similar industries across the Americas. This information could help policymakers prioritize emission reduction efforts within high-impact sectors.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

* Data Type: CSV

The Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors by NAICS 6 dataset provides greenhouse gas (GHG) emission factors for various industries in the United States, categorized by the six-digit NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code. This dataset helps estimate emissions across supply chains by industry sector, allowing for analysis of carbon footprints related to production, transportation, and other operational stages within different economic sectors. Itâ€™s a valuable resource for understanding the environmental impact of industries and can support emissions reduction strategies and sustainability planning.
